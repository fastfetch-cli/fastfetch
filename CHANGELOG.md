# 2.17.0

Changes:
* CMake option `ENABLE_PROPRIETARY_GPU_DRIVER_API` is removed. The GPU driver APIs are now enabled by default.
    * The option was introduced to reduce the license concerns. Since all non MIT proprietary code has been rewritten manually from scratch, it is no longer necessary.
    * See <https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch/issues/533#issuecomment-2122830958> for detail

**We are deprecating flags based config files (will be removed in v3.0.0). We suggest you migrate to json based config files.**

Config related changes:
* The deprecated flag `--gen-config conf` is removed
* Flag `--gen-config` now does the same thing as `--migrate-config`, which can be used as config migration and default config file generation. Flag `--migrate-config` is removed
* Fastfetch now searches for config files in the order of `fastfetch --list-config-paths`, and won't load other config if one is found.
* The undocumented flag `--load-user-config` is removed. As an alternative, `--config none` can be used to disable loading config files.
* `--config` (previously named `--load-config`) is now supported for command line arguments only. If specified, other config files won't be loaded, which works like other programs.
* Config files will always be loaded before other command line flags being parsed. That is to say, command line flags will always override options defined in config files.

# 2.2.0

This release introduces a new option `--migrate-config`, which migrates old flag based config file to new JSONC format

Changes:
* `--pipe` and `--stat` are moved from `general` options to `display` options. This affects cjson configuration.
* Display keys `percent*` and `size*` in JSON config are restructured. e.g. `{ "sizeNdigits": 1 }` is now `{ "size": { "ndigits": 1 } }`
* With the introduction of `--migrate-config`, the old flag based config file is deprecated, and will be removed in 3.0.0 (next major version)
* Support of `--gen-config conf` is deprecated accordingly, and will be removed in 2.3.0 (next minor version)
* The global flag `--allow-slow-operations` is split into some explicit flags in different modules
    * `--packages-winget`: control whether `winget` packages count should be detected. Note it's a very slow operation, please enable it with caution.
    * `--chassis-use-wmi`: control whether `WMI` query should be used to detect chassis type, which detects more information, but slower. This flag only affects `--chassis-format` and `--format json`.
    * `--battery-use-setup-api`: control whether `SetupAPI` should be used on Windows to detect battery info, which supports multi batteries, but slower.
    * `--wm-detect-plugin`: control whether WM plugins should be detected. Note it's implemented with global processes enumeration and can report false results.
    * `--de-slow-version-detection`: control DE version should be detected with slow operations. It's usually not necessary and only provided as a backup.
* `--localip-default-route-only` and `--netio-default-route-only` defaults to true to avoid large number of results

# 2.0.0-beta

Fastfetch v2 introduces a new configuration file format: JSON config. Please refer to <https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch/wiki/Configuration> for details.

Changes:
* Drop the dependency of cJSON. We now use [yyjson](https://ibireme.github.io/yyjson/doc/doxygen/html/index.html) to parse JSON documents.
* Remove `--shell-version` and `--terminal-version`. They are always enabled (Terminal / Shell)
* Remove `--*-error-format`, which seems to be useless
* Remove `--display-detect-name`. Display name is always detected, and will be printed if multiple displays are detected
* Deprecate `--set` and `--set-keyless`; they may be removed in future releases. Use JSON config with Custom module instead
* Remove the special handling of Command module (it can be set once in the triditional `config.conf`). Use JSON config with Command module instead
* Change `--wm-theme-*` to `--wmtheme-*`. Affect `key` and `format` (WMTheme)
* Change `--terminal-font-*` to `--terminalfont-*`. Affect `key` and `format` (TerminalFont)
* Module `Command` uses `/bin/sh` as the default shell on systems other than Windows (Command)
* Fix M2 CPU temperature detection (CPU, macOS)
* Detect monitor name when available, instead of using DRM connector name (Display / Brightness, Linux)

Features:
* FreeBSD support is improved greatly, and actually tested in a physical machine
* Add `--no-buffer` option for easier debugging. CMake option `ENABLE_BUFFER` is removed and always enabled.
* Support `--*-key-color` option to change the key color of specified module
* Support `--colors-symbol` and `--colors-padding-left` (Colors)
* Add LM (Login Manager) module. Currently requires systemd installed (thus Linux only)
* Add `--wmi-timeout` option (Windows)
* Add `--logo-type small` to search for small logos
* Support detecting brightness of external displays with DDC/CI (guard behind `--allow-slow-operations`) (Brightness)
* Add option `--size-ndigits` and `--size-max-prefix` (#494)
* Add option `--processing-timeout` to the timeout when waiting for child processes.
* Public IP module prints the IP location if `--publicip-url` is not set (PublicIP)
* Add option `--localip-default-route-only` (LocalIP)
* Add option `--weather-location` (Weather)
* Support iTerm non-ascii font detection (Terminal, macOS)

* Fix specifying `--set-keyless` with the same key second time won't override the value set before (#517)
* Fix specifying `--color` second time won't clear the value set before (#517)

Logo:
* Change the special handling of `kitty` protocol with `.png` image file to a new image protocol `kitty-direct`. This is the fastest image protocol because fastfetch doesn't need to pre-encode the image to base64 or something and the image content doesn't need to be transmitted via tty. Note:
    1. Although konsole was said to support `kitty` image protocol, it doesn't support `kitty-direct`
    2. wezterm support more image formats other than `.png` (tested with `.jpg` and `.webp`)
* Port all logos supported by neo(wo)fetch. Fastfetch now has 350 builtin logos in total.

# 1.7.0

This release brings support for MacOS!
The basics things are working, but it is far from feature parity with Linux.
I developed this in a VM, so bugs on real hardware are likely.
If you have a Mac and no idea what to do with your free time, i am very happy to accept pull requests / work on issues.

A lot of things were changed under the hood to make this possible, which should bring better performance and stability on all platforms.

Besides that, the following things have changed:

Features:
* The binary prefix used can now be configured, and is used consistently across all modules. Set `--binary-prefix` to `iec` (default), `si` or `jedec`.
* AMD GPUs now have a much better name, if the file `/usr/share/libdrm/amdgpu.ids` exists. For example my dedicated GPU, which was displayed as `AMD/ATI Radeon RX 5600 OEM/5600 XT / 5700/5700 XT`, is now `AMD Radeon RX 5600M`.

* CachyOS small (@sirlucjan, #220)
* MSYS2 (#219)

Bugfixes:
* the `--file` option, which can be used to display the contents of a file as the logo, is now working again.
