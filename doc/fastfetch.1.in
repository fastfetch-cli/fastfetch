.SH CONFIGURATION
.SS "Fetch Structure"
The structure of a fetch describes the modules that should be included in
the output. It consists of a string of modules, separated by a colon (:).
To list all available modules, use \fB\-\-list\-modules\fR

.SS "Config Files"

Fastfetch uses JSONC based format for configuration. Fastfetch doesn't generate
config file automatically; it should be generated manually by \fB\-\-gen\-config\fR.
The config file will be saved in \fB~/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc\fR by default.

A JSONC config file is a JSON file that also supports comments with (// and /* */).
Those files must have the extension '.jsonc'.

The specified configuration/preset files are searched in the following order:

1. relative to the current working directory

2. relative to ~/.local/share/fastfetch/presets/

3. relative to /usr/share/fastfetch/presets/

Fastfetch provides some default presets. List them with \fB\-\-list\-presets\fR.
