        Paste the stacktrace here. You may get it with:

        ```shell
        # You may need Ctrl+C to stop the process if it freezes
        gdb -q -ex 'set confirm off' -ex run -ex 'bt full' -ex quit --args /path/to/fastfetch
        ```

        If you are able to identify which module crashed, the strace can be helpful too

        ```shell
        strace /path/to/fastfetch --multithreading false -s {MODULE} --pipe
        ```

        If you cannot do the instructions above, please upload the core dump file if available.
